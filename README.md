Can't remember scales? Me neither.

This messy doodle has such amazing features as:

* Will mostly display correct notes,
* Can show you all the modes of the major scale(s), but don't try the pentatonics yet, as I haven't added them :),
* When a string is clicked it will play a horrible sound. At least the frequency should be correct.

TODO:

* Add missing scales,
* Add actual guitar sounds,
* Make it not look like shit.
